                        The spray paving industry was introduced in Australia
                        approximately 20 years ago and continues to grow at a
                        staggering rate. The technology and application
                        techniques have improved significantly over this period
                        of time.

                        Our product is a specially formulated coating system
                        that adheres permanently to concrete giving the
                        appearance of a newly laid decorative driveway, patio,
                        pool surround or garage. Spray paving as it is commonly
                        known, has a wide range of applications in both the
                        domestic and commercial sectors.
